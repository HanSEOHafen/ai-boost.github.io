**Note:**

This structure represents a typical static website setup. It includes configuration files like `CNAME` for custom domain linking, a `LICENSE.txt` file that outlines the terms under which the website's content can be used, and a `README.md` file that typically provides an overview of the project, how to set it up, and other important information.

The `assets` folder is divided into subfolders for CSS and JavaScript files, which are crucial for the styling and functionality of the website. The `css` folder includes stylesheets for the website's design, including a version of FontAwesome for iconography, a main stylesheet, and a noscript stylesheet for users who have JavaScript disabled. The `js` folder contains JavaScript files for adding interactivity to the website, including utility scripts, jQuery for easier DOM manipulation, and scripts for responsive design and browser detection.

The `webfonts` folder is reserved for webfont files, which would typically include various font formats to ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices. However, in this simplified structure, it is left empty to indicate the original presence of font files without including them.

The `images` folder is intended to house image files for the website, but it is also left empty in this simplified structure to indicate that images have been excluded.

Finally, the `index.html` file is the entry point to the website, containing the markup that defines the structure and content of the homepage.
